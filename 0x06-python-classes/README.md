# Project Readme: Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview
This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It provides a hands-on introduction to classes, objects, attributes, and methods in Python. The project covers various aspects of OOP, including creating classes, defining attributes, and implementing methods to achieve specific functionalities.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of the following OOP concepts:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- The idea of "first-class everything"
- Understanding what a class is
- Differentiating between a class and an object or instance
- Recognizing what an attribute is and using public, protected, and private attributes
- The significance of `self`
- Working with methods, including the special `__init__` method
- Understanding Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Differentiating between attributes and properties
- Using getters and setters in Python
- Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- Exploring the `__dict__` attribute of a class and/or instance
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
- Utilizing the `getattr` function

## Project Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each building upon the knowledge acquired in the previous ones. The tasks include:

0. **My First Square**: Create an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

1. **Square with Size**: Extend the `Square` class to include a private instance attribute `size` with a setter and getter method.

2. **Size Validation**: Enhance the `Square` class to validate the size attribute during instantiation.

3. **Area of a Square**: Implement a method in the `Square` class to calculate the area of a square.

4. **Printing a Square**: Add a method to the `Square` class for printing a square using the `#` character.

5. **Coordinates of a Square**: Further improve the `Square` class by adding a position attribute and adjusting the printing method accordingly.

6. **Singly Linked List**: Create a class `Node` to define a singly linked list node and a class `SinglyLinkedList` to manage a linked list.

7. **Print Square Instance**: Enhance the `Square` class to allow for direct printing of square instances.

8. **Compare 2 Squares**: Modify the `Square` class to implement comparators for square instances based on their areas.

9. **ByteCode -> Python #5**: Implement the same functionality as a given Python bytecode using a class `MagicClass`.

## Requirements
- You should use an allowed text editor (vi, vim, emacs).
- All code files should be compatible with Python 3.8.5.
- Each code file should include a shebang line as the first line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide using `pycodestyle`.
- All code files must be executable.
- Ensure that your code files include proper documentation, including docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

## How to Use
To complete this project, follow the tasks outlined in the project requirements. You can create Python files for each task and implement the required classes and methods. Test your code to ensure it meets the project's objectives.

Good luck, and enjoy learning about Object-Oriented Programming in Python!
