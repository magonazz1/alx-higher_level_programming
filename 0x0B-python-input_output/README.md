# Python Input/Output Project

## Overview

This project focuses on Python input/output operations, including reading and writing text files, working with JSON data, and creating simple file manipulation scripts. The project aims to enhance your understanding of file handling, serialization, and deserialization in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of Python programming.
- Open, read, and write text files in Python.
- Utilize JSON for serialization and deserialization.
- Implement functions for converting Python objects to JSON strings and vice versa.
- Develop scripts for saving and loading objects to/from files.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of input/output operations. The tasks cover topics such as reading files, writing to files, appending to files, working with JSON data, and creating and loading objects from files.

## Project Tasks

1. **Read File:** Implement a function to read and print the content of a text file.

2. **Write to a File:** Develop a function to write a string to a text file and return the number of characters written.

3. **Append to a File:** Create a function to append a string to the end of a text file and return the number of characters added.

4. **To JSON String:** Implement a function to convert a Python object to a JSON string.

5. **From JSON String to Object:** Develop a function to convert a JSON string to a Python object.

6. **Save Object to a File:** Create a function to save a Python object to a text file using JSON representation.

7. **Create Object from a JSON File:** Implement a function to create a Python object from a JSON file.

8. **Class to JSON:** Write a function to return the dictionary description for JSON serialization of a class object.

9. **Student to JSON:** Create a class representing a student and implement a method to convert it to a JSON dictionary.

10. **Student to JSON with Filter:** Enhance the student class to support filtering attributes when converting to JSON.

11. **Student to Disk and Reload:** Implement methods to save and reload a student object to/from a file.

12. **Pascal's Triangle:** Develop a function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given level.

13. **Search and Update:** Create a function to insert a line of text into a file after each line containing a specific string.

14. **Log Parsing:** Write a script to parse log data and compute metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5 or higher.
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Use of the `pycodestyle` tool for code style checking.
- All files must be executable.
