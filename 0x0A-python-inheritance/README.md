# Project Name: 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Project Overview
The "0x0A. Python - Inheritance" project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum and is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of Python's inheritance mechanisms. You'll work on various tasks to grasp the concept of classes, inheritance, and class hierarchies, and you'll learn how to create Python classes that inherit from others.

## Learning Objectives
By successfully completing this project, you'll gain the following knowledge and skills:
- Understanding why Python programming is powerful and versatile.
- Recognizing the concepts of superclass, base class, or parent class.
- Defining subclasses and the ability to list attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- Learning when instances can have new attributes.
- Mastering the art of inheriting a class from another.
- Exploring how to create classes with multiple base classes.
- Knowing the default class that every class inherits from.
- Learning to override methods or attributes inherited from base classes.
- Understanding which attributes or methods are available to subclasses through inheritance.
- Grasping the purpose of inheritance and how to use built-in functions like `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super`.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 0: Lookup** - Write a function to return the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

- **Task 1: My List** - Create a class `MyList` that inherits from Python's list class. Add a method to print the list in sorted order.

- **Task 2: Same Class or Inherit From** - Write a function to determine if an object is an instance of a specified class.

- **Task 3: Only Subclass Of** - Create a function to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from the specified class.

- **Task 4: Geometry Module** - Define an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

- **Task 5: Improve Geometry** - Enhance the `BaseGeometry` class with an `area()` method that raises an exception.

- **Task 6: Integer Validator** - Create a class `BaseGeometry` with an `integer_validator` method to validate integer values.

- **Task 7: Rectangle** - Develop a `Rectangle` class that inherits from `BaseGeometry` with width and height attributes.

- **Task 8: Full Rectangle** - Enhance the `Rectangle` class with an `area()` method and custom string representations.

- **Task 9: Square #1** - Create a `Square` class inheriting from `Rectangle` with size as an attribute.

- **Task 10: Square #2** - Further improve the `Square` class with custom string representations.

- **Task 11: My Integer** - Design a `MyInt` class that inherits from `int` with inverted equality operators.

- **Task 12: Can I?** - Write a function to add a new attribute to an object if possible, raising an error if not.

## What I learned

At the end of this project, I had acquired expertise in Python inheritance, enabling me to build complex class hierarchies, override methods and attributes, and utilize built-in functions for effective Python programming.
