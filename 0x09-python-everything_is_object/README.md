## Project Title: Python - Everything is an Object

This project focuses on deepening your understanding of Python's object-oriented programming concepts. You will explore various aspects of Python objects, immutability, mutability, aliasing, and more.

### Background Context
In this project, you will delve into the specifics of Python's object behavior. You will explore questions such as the differences between objects, how variables are assigned, and the implications of aliasing. This knowledge is crucial, especially if you are preparing for Python interviews, as you may encounter similar questions.

### Requirements
- Python Scripts: You should write Python scripts that will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5. The code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- README.md: Create a README file at the root of your project folder to provide an overview and explanations.
- .txt Answer Files: Each task's answer should be saved in a .txt file.
- Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs for editing.
- Newline Character: Ensure all your files end with a newline character.
- Shebang: The first line of your script files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Coding Style: Make sure your code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines.
- Executable: All your script files should be executable.
- Word Count: The length of your code files will be tested.
- No Plagiarism: Avoid plagiarism and do not publish content from this project.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- Why Python programming is advantageous.
- What an object is in Python.
- The distinction between a class and an object or instance.
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects.
- What references and aliases are.
- How to determine if two variables are identical.
- How to determine if two variables are linked to the same object.
- Displaying variable identifiers (memory addresses in CPython).
- Understanding mutable and immutable objects.
- Identifying built-in mutable and immutable types.
- How Python passes variables to functions.

### Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of Python objects, variables, and memory management. You are required to provide concise answers to these tasks in text files, following the instructions provided for each task.

### Important Note
This project is an opportunity to deepen your understanding of Python's object-oriented concepts. Avoid copying and pasting answers from external sources or other people's work, as it's essential to learn and practice the concepts presented. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the program.

Python - Everything is object
In this project, I studied object instantiation in Python, delving into variable aliasing and object identifiers, types, and mutability. The project involved a series of quiz-like questions the answers to which I provided in single-line .txt files.
